  <h1>My Top 3 Enhypen's Albums! </h1>
  <p>This is my personal ranking of Enhypen's albums! Enhypen is a South Korean boy band formed by Belift Lab. The group consists of seven members: Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-Ki.</p>

      <h3>🥇. Dimension: Dilemma</h3>        
      <p>This album is very nostalgic to me because when it was released on October 12, 2021, I was very active as an Engene (Enhypen's fanbase). This album is not only memorable for me, but for Enhypen as well as this is their first full-length studio album, with its themes exploring the confusion and internal conflicts a person faces after entering a new, multidimensional world, as symbolized by the "dilemma" of colliding values and desires. </p>

      <h3>🥈. Desire: Unleash</h3>
      <p>ENHYPEN's sixth mini-album, released on June 5, 2025, with "Bad Desire (With or Without You)" as the title track. The EP explores the theme of a deep, sometimes dark, yearning for a loved one, with lyrical concepts revolving around "turning you into a vampire, just like me" and defying fate. My favorite song is the title track's English version.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-">
      <h3>🥉. Manifesto: Day 1</h3>
      <p>Manifesto: Day 1, released on July 4, 2022, is the third extended play by Enhypen. The album consists of six tracks, including the lead single "Future Perfect". I, personally love the b-sides as some are emotional and also catchy.</p>
